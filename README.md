# Wavy :rocket:
A file-sorting app that takes dates from metadata to automatically produce a visual timeline.

## Overview
**Wavy** is a break away from the dated and boring file storage sytstem. The app uses a timestamp algorithm to store and retrieve files, delivering a fast and efficient way to sort through records. A User can upload or drag-in file(s) on their timeline, and the app organizes the files into a visually appealing series of events. Wavy has a 'share' feature that enables sharing of files amongst friends.
